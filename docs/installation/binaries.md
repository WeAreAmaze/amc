# Binaries

Archives of pre-compiled binary files ready for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available. They are static executables. Users of platforms not explicitly listed below should download one of these archives.

If you use macOS Homebrew or Linuxbrew, you can install amc from Amaze's homebrew tap:

```text
brew install amaze/brew/amc 
```
