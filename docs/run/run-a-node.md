# Run a Node

Congratulations, now that you have installed amc, it's time to run it!

In this chapter we'll go through a few different topics you'll encounter when running amc, including:
1. [Running on mainnet or official testnets](./mainnet.md)
1. [Logs and Observability](./observability.md)
1. [Transaction types](./transactions.md)
1. [Ports](./ports.md)
1. [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)

In the future, we also plan to support BTC, ETH, and Sui Stack, which will allow you to run amc as a Layer 2 client. More on this soon!
